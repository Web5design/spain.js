        <p>Douglas Crockford was born in the wilds of Minnesota, but left when he was only six months old because it was just too damn cold. He turned his back on a promising career in television when he discovered computers. He has worked in learning systems, small business systems, office automation, games, interactive music, multimedia, location-based entertainment, social systems, and programming languages. He is the inventor of Tilton, the ugliest programming language that was not specifically designed to be an ugly programming language. He is best known for having discovered that there are good parts in JavaScript. This was an important and unexpected discovery. He also discovered the JSON Data Interchange Format, the world's most loved data format. And he works at PayPal.</p>

        <p>Peter Christensen is a software developer living in the San Francisco area.  He currently works at Manilla and prior to that he worked at Groupon.  He has programmed computers most of his life, starting with Hypercard, and now primarily uses Ruby, Javascript and Clojure.  He's also involved with software development for Tempo Automation, an open pick-and-place machine, and for the OpenROV DIY submersible project.</p>
        
        <h2>Programming the Real World: Javascript for Makers</h2>
        <p>Cheap electronics components have opened up a whole new world of invention.  You can buy a wireless circuit board the size of a quarter and a pocket-sized computer running Linux for under $100.  This puts real-life projects in the price range of millions of innovators: robots, home automation, DIY satellites, and more.<p/>
        <p>
        Javascript is a great language for these projects, because of its efficient runtimes, widespread use, rich libraries, and web roots.  I'll share my experiences working with two hardware projects, including the value that software developers bring to a hardware projects.  Finally, I'll show how to get involved in an existing hardware project or start your own.</p>

        <p>Since he was small, all Teddy Kishi wanted to be was a designer and Flash developer. Fortunately, he was saved early last year when he discovered he was a better programmer than designer and that JavaScript and the DOM was infinitely more interesting.</p>
        
        <h2>A particles system with the DOM</h2>
        <p>The cool kids are all using canvas to make their particle systems. If this comes from a belief that the DOM can't handle it, I'd like to show you that maybe it can. </p>
        <p>With some clever use of Object creation and a bit of clever dynamic CSS transtioning, we can do gravity, friction, collisions and other cool effects in the DOM</p>
