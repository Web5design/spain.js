          There, he maintains The Library, wrecks occasional havoc on the backend and evangelizes what he believes is beautiful technology. As an European citizen (Spain, according to his passport), Vicent enjoys drums and yellow things and the sweet, sweet smell of civilization.

          Jakob is head of engineering at Burt, the Swedish software startup helping publishers and advertisers become more clever and creative with data. It is challenging and complex things that get most of his attention. Professionally this has included leading a technology consultancy firm and starting a few companies in software development and recruitment. But he is a developer at heart, regardless the occupation. Although he is currently focusing on web development and the finer details of JavaScript the journey actually started off with C++ and game development. Lately he has also been sharing his thoughts on advances in programming languages, working in startups and getting things done in software development at a number of universities and conferences, including ScanDev, Nordic Ruby and JSConf. Jakob occasionally blogs at jakobmattsson.se and tweets at @jakobmattsson.

          During the last 10 years, I've been working in small companies mainly and I've had the privilege of participating in the construction of Fon, the largest wi-fi network in the world, currently with more than 2 million nodes.
          I organize events such as Katayunos and Merendojos in the Basque Country and Navarra. I am currently interested in bringing the good practices and methodologies from the server-side to the frontend, in building agile teams and other topics like continuous delivery or devops.
