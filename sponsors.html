        <p>The Pontifical University of Salamanca (UPSA), which dates back to the thirteenth century, has combined its history along the dregs of the academic tradition entrenched in the old Masters, with new tools and educational and training procedures. This openness to advances in knowledge and in doing, without losing the great heritage that encloses the university, has made of our university an indisputable leader in the university system both nationally and internationally.</p>
